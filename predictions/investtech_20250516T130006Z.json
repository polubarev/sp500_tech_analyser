    "analysis": "S&P 500 has broken the floor of the rising trend channel in the medium long term, which indicates a weaker initial rising rate. The index is between support at points 5820 and resistance at points 6100. A definitive break through of one of these levels predicts the new direction. RSI above 70 shows that the index has strong positive momentum in the short term. Investors have steadily paid more to buy the index, which indicates increasing optimism and that the price will continue to rise. However, particularly for big stocks, high RSI may be a sign that the stock is overbought and that there is a chance of a reaction downwards.
