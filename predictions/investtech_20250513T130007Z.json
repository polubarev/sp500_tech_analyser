    "analysis": "S&P 500 is in a rising trend channel in the short term. This shows that investors over time have bought the index at higher prices and indicates good development for the market. The index has broken up through resistance at points 5780. This predicts a further rise. In case of negative reactions, there will now be support at points 5780. RSI above 70 shows that the index has strong positive momentum in the short term. Investors have steadily paid more to buy the index, which indicates increasing optimism and that the price will continue to rise. However, particularly for big stocks, high RSI may be a sign that the stock is overbought and that there is a chance of a reaction downwards. The index is overall assessed as technically positive for the short term.",
